    \begin{abstract}
        For over a century, fingerprints have been an undisputed
        personal identifier.  Recent court rulings have sparked
        interest in verifying unique techniques to make the current
        methods even more reliable. Ducks, as they do not have
        fingers, play a key role in the development of new methods to
        protect the innocent of our society.
